# About

Leap Juggling is a simple juggling simulation game.

# How to play

You can either play with a `keyboard` and `mouse` or with a *Leap Motion*.

#### Keyboard and Mouse
Press `space bar` to throw balls from left hand to right hand and a `mouse click` to throw them from right hand to left hand. You can also use the `mouse swipe` to control the position of the right hand. 

#### Leap Motion 
Do a `key tap gesture` with the left hand to throw balls from left hand to right hand and a `key tap gesture` with the right hand to throw them from right hand to left hand. You can also use your right hand to control the position of the right hand on the game. 

Technology
----------
The game was made using *Action Script 3* and to integrate the *Leap Motion* capabilities we used [Leap Motion AS3 API](https://github.com/logotype/LeapMotionAS3).
